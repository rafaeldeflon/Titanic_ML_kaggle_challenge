# Titanic_ML_kaggle_challenge

This is my project for the kaggle's 'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster' challenge > https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/

## The files

This repository has 5 csv's files: gender_sumission (the archive model of submission for the challenge), test (the test data for the ML models), train (the Titanic's passengers data) and the 2 archives built for submission on kaggle.


## The models

In the end 2 Models were built with scikit-learn.

One made by logistic regression with 80.13 (%) accuracy and 0,76315 score on the kaggle challenge.

and another with decision tree classifier with 82.72 (%) accuracy and 0,77511 score on the kaggle challenge.
